            <p>Being active has been a part of my life since I was a kid.</p>
            <p>As a kid I always part of some sort of team sport during the school year. Summers were for the pool and pick-up sports with friends. From these early sports I learned that moving could be FUN! In high school I started to dabble in weight lifting because at 6’ and 140lbs I could use a little meat on my bones and also. . . girls. I continued the pick-up sports and unstructured weight lifting into college and then found the sport of Ultimate Frisbee (Yes! It is a sport, I promise!). Through Ultimate Frisbee I meet two friends who planted the seed that grew into a fascination of how the body adapts and improves through being stressed, aka workingout. For years after I did my own research into the fitness world. During this time, I became a rock-climbing coach. Through my coaching I found a love to see people grow and improve. It was only a matter of time before I decided I would get my personal training certificate.</p>
            <p>I can’t wait to discover your fitness goals and to be able to help guild you through your fitness journey.</p>
